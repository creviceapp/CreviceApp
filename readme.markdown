CreviceApp is a mouse gesture utility that consists of fully tested small and robust core of 2000 lines, thin GUI wrapper and [Microsoft Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).
Mouse gestures can be defined as a csx file, so there is noting can not do.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

This software requires Windows7 or later, and .Net Framework 4.6.

## Config csx file

After first starting of `CreviceApp.exe`, move to `%APPDATA%\Crevice\CreviceApp`, and you could find `default.csx`. It's the config file. Please open it with a text editor and look through it. 

## Mouse gesture DSL

Firstly, all gestures start with `@when` clause represent the condition for the activation of a mouse gesture.
```cs
var Chrome = @when((ctx) =>
{
    return ctx.ForegroundWindow.ModuleName == "chrome.exe";
});
```

The following clauses to `@when` is `@on`, `@if` and `@do`. 

```cs
Chrome.
@on(RightButton).
@if(MoveDown, MoveRight).
@do((ctx) =>
{
    SendInput.Multiple().
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LCONTROL).
    KeyDown(VK_W).
    KeyUp(VK_W).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LCONTROL).
    Send(); // Send Ctrl+W to Chrome
});
```


`@on` caluse tells the system that which mouse button will be used when the gesture starts. 
`@if` clause also tells the trigger of the action of the gesture. 
And finally, `@do` clause represents the action of the gesture will be acivated when all given conditions to be satisfied. 

### Stroke gestures

Mouse gestures with strokes, namely, stroke gestures, is the most used and  needed of some kinds of mouse gestures. 
CreviceApp naturally supports this.
`@if` clause takes movements of the mouse, combination of `MoveUp`, `MoveDown`, `MoveLeft` and `MoveRight`, as it's argument then.

```cs
Chrome.
@on(RightButton).
@if(MoveUp, MoveDown, MoveLeft, MoveRight, ...). // There is no limit on the length.
@do((ctx) => {
    SendInput.Multiple().
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LCONTROL).
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LSHIFT).
    KeyDown(VK_T).
    KeyUp(VK_T).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LSHIFT).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LCONTROL).
    Send(); // Send Ctrl+Shift+T to Chrome
});
```

### Button gestures
As you may know, mouse gestures with buttons is called "rocker gestures" around mouse gesture utility communities. 
But we call it "button gestures" here. 
CreviceApp supports two kinds of button gestures. 
Both these button gestures are almost the same except that one have `@on` clause and the other one do not have it. 
At this time, `@if` clause takes a mouse button, any of following, `LeftButton`, `MiddleButton`, `RightButton`, `WheelUp`, `WheelDown`, `WheelLeft`, `WheelRight`, `X1Button` and `X2Button`, as it's argument to tell the system that which mouse button is the trigger of the action of the gesture.

#### Button gestures (with `@on` clause)

```cs
Chrome.
@on(RightButton).
@if(WheelDown).
@do((ctx) =>
{
    SendInput.Multiple().
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_CONTROL).
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_TAB).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_TAB).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_CONTROL).
    Send(); // Send Ctrl+Tab to Chrome
});
```

#### Button gestures (without `@on` clause)

```cs
Chrome.
@if(WheelLeft).
@do((ctx) =>
{
    SendInput.Multiple().
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LMENU).
    ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LEFT).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LEFT).
    ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LMENU).
    Send(); // Send Alt+Left to Chrome
});
```

## Core API

### ExecutionContext
`@when` clause and `@do` clause take a function as it's argument, and the function takes an `ExecutionContext` as it's argument. 
An `ExecutionContext` will be generated each time gestures started, and the same instance of it will be given to the functions of `@when` and `@do` to guarantee that these functions will be executed on the same context.

#### Properties

##### ForegroundWindow

The window which was on the foreground when a gesture started. 
This is an instance of `WindowInfo`.

##### PointedWindow

The window which was under the cursor when a gesture started. 
This is an instance of `WindowInfo`.

### WindowInfo

`WindowInfo` is a thin wrapper of the handle of a window. This class provides functions to use window handles more easily.

#### Properties
This class provides `WindowHandle`, `ThreadId`, `ProcessId`, `WindowId`, `Text`, `ClassName`, `Parent`, `ModulePath` and `ModuleName` as it's property.

#### Methods

##### SendMessage(uint Msg, uint wParam, uint lParam)

A shortcut to win32 API `SendMessage(WindowHandle, Msg, wParam, lParam)`. 
This returns a `long` value returned by win32 API as is.

##### PostMessage(uint Msg, uint wParam, uint lParam)

A shortcut to win32 API `PostMessage(WindowHandle, Msg, wParam, lParam)`.
This returns a `bool` value returned by win32 API as is.

##### BringWindowToTop()

A shortcut to win32 API `BringWindowToTop(WindowHandle)`.
This returns a `bool` value returned by win32 API as is.

##### FindWindowEx(IntPtr hwndChildAfter, string lpszClass, string lpszWindow)

A shortcut to win32 API `FindWindowEx(WindowHandle, hwndChildAfter, lpszClass, lpszWindow)`.
This returns an instance of `WindowInfo`.

##### FindWindowEx(string lpszClass, string lpszWindow)

A shortcut to win32 API `FindWindowEx(WindowHandle, IntPtr.Zero, lpszClass, lpszWindow)`.
This returns an instance of `WindowInfo`.

##### GetChildWindows()

A shortcut to win32 API `EnumChildWindows(WindowHandle, EnumWindowProc, IntPtr.Zero)`.
This returns an instance of `IEmumerable<WindowInfo>`.

##### GetPointedDescendantWindows(Point point, Window.WindowFromPointFlags flags)

A shortcut to win32 API `ChildWindowFromPointEx(hWnd, point, flags)`.
This method recursively calls `ChildWindowFromPointEx` until the last descendant window and returns an instance of `IEmumerable<WindowInfo>`.

##### GetPointedDescendantWindows(Point point)

A shortcut to win32 API `ChildWindowFromPointEx(hWnd, point, Window.WindowFromPointFlags.CWP_ALL)`.
This method recursively calls `ChildWindowFromPointEx` until the last descendant window and returns an instance of `IEmumerable<WindowInfo>`.

### SendInput

Send mouse and keyboard input events to the foreground window. 
This API provides single and multiple sending method. 
The events sent by single sending method is guaranteed to arrive to the window in order, but this does not necessarily mean it will not be interrupted by the other events. 
Multiple sending method guarantees that the events sent by it will not be interrupted by the other events.
Both methods support the same API for sending mouse and keyboard events except that multiple sending method is need to be called `Send()` at last.

```cs
SendInput.ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LWIN);
// When D key interrupts here,
// Win+D will be invoked unintentionally.
SendInput.ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LWIN); 
```

```cs
SendInput.Multiple().
ExtendedKeyDown(VK_LWIN).
ExtendedKeyUp(VK_LWIN).
Send(); // This won't interrupted by any other input.
```

#### Mouse event
`Down`, `Up` and `Click` events are supported for the push-release type buttons of mouse devices, `LeftButton`, `MiddleButton`, `RightButton`, `X1Button` and `X2Button`. For example, the provided API for `LeftButton` is `LeftDown()`, `LeftUp()`, `LeftClick()`. 

For single push type buttons, `WheelUp()`, `WheelDown()`, `WheelLeft()` and `WheelRight()` are provided. 

For move events, `Move(int dx, int dy)` and `MoveTo(int x, int y)` are also provided.

#### Keyboard event

A keyboard event is synthesized from a key code with two logical flags, `ExtendedKey` and  `ScanCode`. For sending `Up` and `Down` events for a key, `KeyDown(ushort keyCode)` and `KeyUp(ushort keyCode)` are provided. 

```cs
SendInput.KeyDown(VK_A);
SendInput.KeyUp(VK_A); // Send `A` to the foreground application.
```

`ExetendedKeyDown(ushort keyCode)` and `ExtentedKeyUp(ushort keyCode)` are provided when `ExtendedKey` flag is needed to be set.

```cs
SendInput.ExetendedKeyDown(VK_LWIN);
SendInput.ExtentedKeyUp(VK_LWIN); // Send `Win` to the foreground application.
```

For the API combined four API above mentioned with `ScanCode` flag,
`KeyDownWithScanCode(ushort keyCode)`, `KeyUpWithScanCode(ushort keyCode)`, `ExtendedKeyDownWithScanCode(ushort keyCode)` and `ExtendedKeyUpWithScanCode(ushort keyCode)` are also provided.

```cs
SendInput.ExtendedKeyDownWithScanCode(VK_LCONTROL);
SendInput.KeyDownWithScanCode(VK_S);
SendInput.KeyUpWithScanCode(VK_S);
SendInput.ExtendedKeyUpWithScanCode(VK_LCONTROL); // Send `Ctrl+S` with scan code to the foreground application.
```

And finally, for the API to support an other special `Unicode` flag, `UnicodeKeyDown(char c)`, `UnicodeKeyUp(char c)` and `UnicodeKeyStroke(string str)` are provided.

```cs
SendInput.UnicodeKeyDown('üç£');
SendInput.UnicodeKeyUp('üç£'); // Send `Sushi` to the foreground application.
```

Note: `keyCode` is a virtual key code. See [Virtual-Key Codes (Windows)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx).
CreviceApp provides virtual keys as `VK_XXXX`, but for `VK_0` to `VK_9` and `VK_A` to `VK_Z`, this is an extension for convenience limited in this application.

### Notification

#### Tooltip(string text)

Show tooltip message on the right bottom corner of the display on the cusor.

```cs
Tooptip("This is tooltip.");
```

#### Baloon(string text)

Show baloon message.

```cs
Baloon("This is baloon.");
```
